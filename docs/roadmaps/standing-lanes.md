# Standing Lanes

Status: active
Owner: Tom
Updated: 2026-08-21

These lanes outlive a generation. They are not generation runway goals
and they do not keep a generation open.

## Contract 029 Currentness

Authority: Contract 029 Recurring Currentness Checkpoint and Upgrade
Workflow. Runbook:
[Version Currentness Checkpoint](../guides/version-currentness-checkpoint.md).
Execute through the repo skill `version-currentness`.

Cadence is operator-triggered: after a consumer defect on an
unverified-newer point, after a cluster of stables move, or when the
operator asks. It is not CI and not a calendar job.

A checkpoint writes research. It does not change claims and does not
need an active generation.

One-family qualification that changes a claim compiles into the
then-active generation. If none is active, stop and ask. Do not invent a
generation to house currentness.

Last one-family claim: Ollama attached `0.32.15` (g04.027, PR 22).
The immediately preceding claim is Qwen headless `0.21.15` (g04.026,
PR 21). Both are merged. Neither changes the generation pointer.

### Current Deferrals

- Gemini requalification stays deferred until the operator lifts that
  gate.

### Do Not

- treat currentness as a reason to keep a generation active
- bulk-bump from registry `latest`
- leave the current host or official stable `UnverifiedNewer` without a
  named incompatible reason

## Next Task

Implement the active roadmap card named by the
[roadmaps front door](README.md#next-task). This file records standing
lanes; the batch pointer stays in the front door.
