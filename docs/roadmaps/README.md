# Roadmaps

Roadmaps sequence work after vision, architecture, and contracts provide enough
shape.

## Current Generation

- [g05 Agent Runtime Surfaces And Route Truth](g05/README.md) — active
- [g04 Route Readiness And Connection Admission](g04/README.md) — completed
- [g03 Compatibility Maintenance And Consumer-Proven Hardening](g03/README.md) — completed
- [g02 Swallowtail Stabilization And Release Discipline](g02/README.md) — completed
- [g01 Swallowtail Foundation](g01/README.md) — completed
- [Generation Index](generation-index.md)
- [Long-Term Plan](long-term-plan.md)

## Next Task

Define the complete operator authority packet required by
[g05.021 card 052](g05/batch-cards/052-v0-4-0-consumer-proof-and-operator-tag-gate.md).
Card 051 is complete: PR 201 exact head `10d9b7a0` merged as immutable candidate
`56f3913a`, and canonical workflow-dispatch run 33853812785 passed all six jobs
at that exact SHA. Card 052 remains planned and blocked until the operator names
the working application and repository, normal route and command, exact
candidate consumption, credential and provider authority, permitted mutations,
retained and redacted evidence, cleanup, retry budget, and stop behavior. Do not
select or run a smoke by inference. Release execution, tag creation, tag push,
publication, provider work, and consumer mutation remain unauthorized.

## Standing Lanes

Generation-independent work lives in
[standing-lanes.md](standing-lanes.md). Contract 029 currentness is the
first standing lane. It does not keep a generation open.

## Index

- [generation-index.md](./generation-index.md) — generation status
- [status-grammar.md](./status-grammar.md) — Status buckets and census phrases
  for `qa:docs:roadmaps:status`
- [long-term-plan.md](./long-term-plan.md) — staged multi-consumer adoption
- [per-route-feature-completion.md](g04/per-route-feature-completion.md) —
  route-local feature delivery programme
- [per-route-feature-inventory.md](g04/per-route-feature-inventory.md) — live
  disposition counts and parallel qualification queue
- [standing-lanes.md](standing-lanes.md) — generation-independent lanes
- [backlog/README.md](backlog/README.md) — deferred work and promotion gates
- [g01/README.md](g01/README.md) — completed foundation generation
- [g02/README.md](g02/README.md) — completed stabilization, provider-wide
  facade, activity, compatibility, and lifecycle generation
- [g03/README.md](g03/README.md) — completed compatibility-maintenance and
  consumer-proven hardening generation
- [g04/README.md](g04/README.md) — completed route-readiness and
  connection-admission generation
- [g05/README.md](g05/README.md) — active watchers, bounded skill inventory,
  feature projection, and route-currentness generation

## Status And Census

Batch-card and milestone `Status:` lines, plus the active generation census in
`generation-index.md`, must match
[status-grammar.md](./status-grammar.md). That note names the live regexes in
`scripts/check-roadmap-status-drift.py`. `gated` is detail after an accepted
bucket, not a status by itself.

## Generation Shape

Generations normally collect 30-50 numbered roadmaps. Batch cards sit inside
those roadmaps and do not count toward the generation range. A phase boundary
does not imply a generation rollover.
